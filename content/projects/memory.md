Memory is a complex cognitive process. It enables us to re-construct the past and imagine the future. There are still many aspects of memory we do not understand. At LCBC we aim to explore different aspects of memory and how this process is reflected in the brain.

Most of our research projects contain measures of memory, as this is a key cognitive function we study. There are, however, several of our projects that specifically focus on studying memory processes.
